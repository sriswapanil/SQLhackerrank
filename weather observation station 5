Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

solution 

SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT city, LENGTH(city) FROM station ORDER BY LENGTH(city) ASC, city ASC) WHERE ROWNUM = 1
 UNION
SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT city, LENGTH(city) FROM station ORDER BY LENGTH(city) DESC, city ASC) WHERE ROWNUM = 1;
